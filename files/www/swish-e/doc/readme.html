<h1><a name="upgrading_"></a>Upgrading?</h1>

<p>If you are upgrading Swish-e, please review the CHANGES file before installation.
The index format may change and existing indexes may need to be re-created before
use.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="overview"></a>OVERVIEW</h1>

<p>Swish-e is <b>S</b>imple <b>W</b>eb <b>I</b>ndexing <b>S</b>ystem for <b>H</b>umans - <b>E</b>nhanced.
Swish-e can quickly and easily index directories of files or remote web sites
and search the generated indexes.</p>
<p>Swish-e is extremely fast in both indexing and searching, highly
configurable, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing web sites to
maintain a consistent design. Swish-e can index web pages, but can just as
easily index text files, mailing list archives, or data stored in a
relational database.</p>
<p>Swish is designed to index small- to medium-sized collection of documents,
Although a few users are indexing over a million documents, typical usage
is more often in the tens of thousands.  Currently, Swish-e only indexes
eight bit character encodings.</p>
<p>Swish-e version 2.2 was a major rewrite of the code and the addition of many
new features.  Memory requirements for indexing have been reduced and
indexing speed is significantly improved from previous versions. New
features allow more control over indexing, better document parsing, improved
indexing and searching logic, better filter code, and the ability to index
from any data source.</p>
<p>Swish-e version 2.4 includes a major rewrite of the C API and a new Perl
module for accessing the Swish-e C library.  In addition, Swish-e 2.4 uses
the GNU Auto Tools.  The significant changes are where files are installed,
and the use of Libtool to create the Swish-e library as a shared library on
many platforms.  Basically, installation is easier than previous versions,
and more files are installed in "standard" locations (e.g. documentation
is installed in <code>$prefix/share/doc/swish-e</code>).</p>
<p>Note: Due to the new build and installation system in Swish-e 2.4, some 
documentation may incorrectly list the location of files.  Please report
any documentation errors to the Swish-e Discussion list.</p>
<p>Swish-e is not a "turn-key" indexing and searching solution.  The Swish-e
distribution contains most of the parts to create such a system, but you
need to put the parts together as best meets your needs. This gives you the
power to index and search your documents the way you wish and to seamlessly
integrate a search engine into your web site or application.</p>
<p>To use Swish-e, you will need to configure Swish-e to index your documents,
create an index by running Swish-e, and setup an interface such as a CGI
script (a script is included) to search the index and display results. 
Swish uses helper programs to index documents of types that Swish-e cannot
natively index.  These programs may need to be installed separately from
Swish-e.</p>
<p>Swish-e is an Open Source (see: <a href="http://opensource.org">http://opensource.org</a> ) program supported by
developers and a large group of users. Please take time to join the Swish-e
discussion list at <a href="http://Swish-e.org">http://Swish-e.org</a> .</p>

<h1><a name="swish_e_s_history"></a>Swish-e's History</h1>

<p>SWISH was created by Kevin Hughes, circa 1994, to fill the need of the growing number
of Web administrators on the Internet - many of the indexing systems were
not well documented, were hard to use and install, and were too complex
for their own good. The system was widely used for several years, long
enough to collect some bug fixes and requests for enhancements.</p>
<p>In Fall 1996, The Library of UC Berkeley received permission from
Kevin Hughes to implement bug fixes and enhancements to the original
binary. The result is Swish-enhanced or Swish-e, brought to you by the
Swish-e Development Team.</p>
