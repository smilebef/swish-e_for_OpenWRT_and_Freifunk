<h1><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p><code>swish.cgi</code> is a CGI script for searching with the SWISH-E search
engine version 2.1-dev and above.  It returns results a page at a
time, with matching words from the source document highlighted,
showing a few words of content on either side of the highlighted word.</p>
<p>The script is highly configurable.  Features include searching
multiple (or selectable) indexes, limiting searches to a subset of documents,
sorting by a number of different properties, and limiting results to
a date range.</p>
<p>On unix type systems the swish.cgi script is installed in the directory
$prefix/lib/swish-e, which is typically /usr/local/lib/swish-e.  This
can be overridden by the configure options --prefix or --libexecdir.</p>
<p>The standard configuration (i.e. not using a config file) should work
with most swish index files.  Customization of the parameters will be
needed if you are indexing special meta data and want to search and/or
display the meta data.  The configuration can be modified by editing
this script directly, or by using a configuration file (.swishcgi.conf
by default).  The script's configuration file is described below.</p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to get the default configuration working
before making changes.  Most problems using this script are the result
of configuration modifications.</p>
<p>The script is modular in design.  Both the highlighting code and
output generation is handled by modules, which are included in the
<i>example/modules</i> distribution directory and installed in the
$libexecdir/perl directory.
This allows for easy customization of
the output without changing the main CGI script.</p>
<p>Included with the Swish-e distribution is a module to generate standard HTML
output.  There's also modules and template examples to use with the popular
Perl templating systems HTML::Template and Template-Toolkit.  This is very
useful if your site already uses one of these templating systems The
HTML::Template and Template-Toolkit packages are not distributed with
Swish-e.  They are available from the CPAN (<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>).</p>
<p>This scipt can also run basically unmodified as a mod_perl handler,
providing much better performance than running as a CGI script.  Usage
under mod_perl is described below.</p>
<p>Please read the rest of the documentation.  There's a <code>DEBUGGING</code>
section, and a <code>FAQ</code> section.</p>
<p>This script should work on Windows, but security may be an issue.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="requirements"></a>REQUIREMENTS</h1>

<p>A reasonably current version of Perl.  5.00503
or above is recommended (anything older will not be supported).</p>
<p>The Date::Calc module is required to use the date range feature of the script.
The Date::Calc module is also available from CPAN.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="installation"></a>INSTALLATION</h1>

<p>Here's an example installation session under Linux.  It should be
similar for other operating systems.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity in this installation example all files are
placed in web server space, including files such as swish-e index and
configuration files that would normally not be made available via the
web server.  Access to these files should be limited once the script
is running.  Either move the files to other locations (and adjust the
script's configuration) or use features of the web server to limit
access (such as with <i>.htaccess</i>).</p>
<p>Please get a simple installation working before modifying the
configuration file.  Most problems reported for using this script have
been due to improper configuration.</p>
<p>The script's default settings are setup for initial testing.  By default the settings expect
to find most files and the swish-e binary in the same directory as the script.</p>
<p>For <i>security</i> reasons, once you have tested the script you will want to change settings to
limit access to some of these files by the web server (either by moving them out of web
space, or using access control such as <i>.htaccess</i>). An example of using <i>.htaccess</i> on
Apache is given below.</p>
<p>It's expected that swish-e has already been unpacked and the swish-e binary has be compiled
from source and "make install" has been run. If swish-e was installed from a vendor package
(such as from a RPM or Debian package) see that pakage's documentation for where files are
installed.</p>
<p>Example Installation:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="item_1"></a><a name="1"></a><b>1 Symlink or copy the swish.cgi.</b>
<p>Symlink (or copy if your platform or webserver does not allow symlinks)
the swish.cgi script from the installation directory to a local directory.
Typically, this would be the cgi-bin directory or a location where CGI script
are located.  In this example a new directory is created and the script is
symlinked.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~$ mkdir swishdir
    ~$ cd swishdir
    ~/swishdir$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/swish-e/swish.cgi</pre>
<p>The installation directory is set at configure time with the --prefix or
--libexecdir options, but by default is in /usr/local/lib/swish-e.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_2"></a><a name="2"></a><b>2 Create an index</b>
<p>Use an editor and create a simple configuration file for indexing your
files.  In this example the Apache documentation is indexed.  Last we
run a simple query to test that the index works correctly.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ cat swish.conf
    IndexDir /usr/local/apache/htdocs
    IndexOnly .html .htm
    DefaultContents HTML*
    StoreDescription HTML* &lt;body&gt; 200000
    MetaNames swishdocpath swishtitle
    ReplaceRules remove /usr/local/apache/</pre>
<p>If you do not have the Apache docs installed then pick another directory to index
such as /usr/share/doc.</p>
<p>Create the index.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ swish-e -c swish.conf

    Indexing done!</pre>
<p>Now, verify that the index can be searched:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ swish-e -w install -m 1
    # SWISH format: 2.1-dev-25
    # Search words: install
    # Number of hits: 14
    # Search time: 0.001 seconds
    # Run time: 0.040 seconds
    1000 htdocs/manual/dso.html "Apache 1.3 Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support" 17341
    .</pre>
<p>Let's see what files we have in our directory now:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ ls -1
    index.swish-e
    index.swish-e.prop
    swish.cgi
    swish.conf</pre>
</li>
<li><a name="item_3"></a><a name="3"></a><b>3 Test the CGI script</b>
<p>This is a simple step, but often overlooked.  You should test from the command line instead of jumping
ahead and testing with the web server.  See the <code>DEBUGGING</code> section below for more information.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ ./swish.cgi | head
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
           &lt;title&gt;
              Search our site
           &lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;</pre>
<p>The above shows that the script can be run directly, and generates a correct HTTP header and HTML.</p>
<p>If you run the above and see something like this:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir &gt;./swish.cgi
    bash: ./swish.cgi: No such file or directory</pre>
<p>then you probably need to edit the script to point to the correct location of your perl program.
Here's one way to find out where perl is located (again, on unix):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ which perl
    /usr/local/bin/perl

    ~/swishdir$ /usr/local/bin/perl -v
    This is perl, v5.6.0 built for i586-linux
    ...</pre>
<p>Good! We are using a reasonably current version of perl.</p>
<p>Now that we know perl is at <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> we can adjust the "shebang" line
in the perl script (e.g. the first line of the script):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ pico swish.cgi
    (edit the #! line)
    ~/swishdir$ head -1 swish.cgi
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</pre>
</li>
<li><a name="item_4"></a><a name="4"></a><b>4 Test with the web server</b>
<p>How you do this is completely dependent on your web server, and you may need to talk to your web
server admin to get this working.  Often files with the .cgi extension are automatically set up to
run as CGI scripts, but not always.  In other words, this step is really up to you to figure out!</p>
<p>This example shows creating a <i>symlink</i> from the web server space to the directory used above.
This will only work if the web server is configured to follow symbolic links (the default for Apache).</p>
<p>This operation requires root access:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ su -c "ln -s $HOME/swishdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/swishdir"
    Password: *********</pre>
<p>If your account is on an ISP and your web directory is <i>~/public_html</i> the you might just move the entire
directory:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    mv ~/swishdir ~/public_html</pre>
<p>Now, let's make a real HTTP request:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ GET http://localhost/swishdir/swish.cgi | head -3
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
    package SwishSearch;
    use strict;</pre>
<p>Oh, darn. It looks like Apache is not running the script and instead returning it as a
static page.  Apache needs to be told that swish.cgi is a CGI script.</p>
<p><i>.htaccess</i> comes to the rescue:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir$ cat .htaccess

    # Deny everything by default
    Deny From All

    # But allow just CGI script
    &lt;files swish.cgi&gt;
        Options ExecCGI
        Allow From All
        SetHandler cgi-script
    &lt;/files&gt;</pre>
<p>That "Deny From All" prevents access to all files (such as config and index files), and only access is allowed to the
<i>swish.cgi</i> script.</p>
<p>Let's try the request one more time:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishdir &gt;GET http://localhost/swishdir/swish.cgi | head
    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
           &lt;title&gt;
              Search our site
           &lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="http://swish-e.org"&gt;</pre>
<p>That looks better!  Now use your web browser to test.</p>
<p>Now, you may note that the links are not valid on the search results page.  The swish config file
contained the line:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">     ReplaceRules remove /usr/local/apache/</pre>
<p>To make those links works (and assuming your web server will follow symbolic links):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ ln -s /usr/local/apache/htdocs</pre>
<p>BTW - "GET" used above is a program included with Perl's LWP library.  If you do no have this you might
try something like:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    wget -O - http://localhost/swishdir/swish.cgi | head</pre>
<p>and if nothing else, you can always telnet to the web server and make a basic request.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ telnet localhost 80
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.

<p>This may seem like a lot of work compared to using a browser, but browsers
are a poor tool for basic CGI debugging.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have problems check the <code>DEBUGGING</code> section below.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="configuration"></a>CONFIGURATION</h1>

<p>If you want to change the location of the swish-e binary or the index
file, use multiple indexes, add additional metanames and properties,
change the default highlighting behavior, etc., you will need to
adjust the script's configuration settings.</p>
<p>Again, please get a test setup working with the default parameters before
making changes to any configuration settings.  Better to debug one
thing at a time...</p>
<p>In general, you will need to adjust the script's settings to match the
index file you are searching.  For example, if you are indexing a
hypermail list archive you may want to make the script use
metanames/properties of Subject, Author, and, Email address.  Or you
may wish to provide a way to limit searches to subsets of documents
(e.g. parts of your directory tree).</p>
<p>To make things somewhat "simple", the configuration parameters are
included near the top of the swish.cgi program.  That is the only
place that the individual parameters are defined and explained, so you
will need to open up the swish.cgi script in an editor to view the
options.  Further questions about individual settings should be
referred to the swish-e discussion list.</p>
<p>The parameters are all part of a perl <code>hash</code> structure, and the
comments at the top of the program should get you going.  The perl
hash structure may seem a bit confusing, but it makes it easy to
create nested and complex parameters.  Syntax is important, so
cut-n-paste should be your best defense if you are not a perl
programmer.</p>
<p>By the way, Perl has a number of quote operators.  For example, to
quote a string you might write:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    title =&gt; 'Search My Site',</pre>
<p>Some options take more than one parameter, where each parameter must
be quoted.  For example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    metanames =&gt; [ 'swishdefault', 'swishtitle',  'swishdocpath' ],</pre>
<p>which assigns an array ( [...] ) of three strings to the "metanames"
variable.  Lists of quoted strings are so common in perl that there's
a special operator called "qw" (quote word) to save typing all those quotes:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    metanames =&gt; [ qw/ swishdefault swishtitle swishdocpath / ],</pre>
<p>or to use the parenthesis as the quote character (you can pick any):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    metanames =&gt; [ qw( swishdefault swishtitle swishdocpath ) ],</pre>
<p>There are two options for changing the configuration settings from
their default values: One way is to edit the script directly, or the
other was is to use a separate configuration file.  In either case,
the configuration settings are a basic perl hash reference.</p>
<p>Using a configuration file is described below, but contains the same hash structure.</p>
<p>There are many configuration settings, and some of them are commented out either by using
a "#" symbol, or by simply renaming the configuration directive (e.g. by adding an "x" to the parameter
name).</p>
<p>A very basic configuration setup might look like:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    return {
        title           =&gt; 'Search the Swish-e list',   # Title of your choice.
        swish_binary    =&gt; 'swish-e',                   # Location of swish-e binary
        swish_index     =&gt; 'index.swish-e',             # Location of your index file
    };</pre>
<p>Or if searching more than one index:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    return {
        title           =&gt; 'Search the Swish-e list',
        swish_binary    =&gt; 'swish-e',
        swish_index     =&gt; ['index.swish-e', 'index2'],
    };</pre>
<p>Both of these examples return a reference to a perl hash ( <code>return
{...}</code> ).  In the second example, the multiple index files are set as
an array reference.</p>
<p>Note that in the example above the swish-e binary file is relative to
the current directory.  If running under mod_perl you will need to use
absolute paths.</p>
<p>The script can also use the SWISH::API perl module (included with the
swish-e distribution in the <i>perl</i> directory) to access the swish-e
index.  The <code>use_library</code> option is used to enable the use of the
SWISH::API module:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    return {
        title           =&gt; 'Search the Swish-e list',
        swish_index     =&gt; ['index.swish-e', 'index2'],
        use_library     =&gt; 1, # enable use of the SWISH::API module
    };</pre>
<p>The module must be available via the @INC array, like all Perl modules.</p>
<p>Using the SWISH::API module avoids the need to fork and execute a
the swish-e program.  Under mod_perl you will may see a significant
performance improvement when using the SWISH::API module.  Under
normal CGI usage you will probably not see any speed improvements.</p>
<p><b>Using A Configuration File</b></p>
<p>As mentioned above, configuration settings can be either set in the
<i>swish.cgi</i> script, or set in a separate configuration file.
Settings in a configuration file will override the settings in the
script.</p>
<p>By default, the <i>swish.cgi</i> script will attempt to read settings from the file <i>.swishcgi.conf</i>.
For example, you might only wish to change the title used
in the script.  Simply create a file called <i>.swishcgi.conf</i> in the same directory as the CGI script:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    &gt; cat .swishcgi.conf
    # Example swish.cgi configuration script.
    return {
       title =&gt; 'Search Our Mailing List Archive',
    };</pre>
<p>The settings you use will depend on the index you create with swish:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">   return {
        title           =&gt; 'Search the Apache documentation',
        swish_binary    =&gt; 'swish-e',
        swish_index     =&gt; 'index.swish-e',
        metanames       =&gt; [qw/swishdefault swishdocpath swishtitle/],
        display_props   =&gt; [qw/swishtitle swishlastmodified swishdocsize swishdocpath/],
        title_property  =&gt; 'swishdocpath',
        prepend_path    =&gt; 'http://myhost/apachedocs',

        name_labels =&gt; {
            swishdefault        =&gt; 'Search All',
            swishtitle          =&gt; 'Title',
            swishrank           =&gt; 'Rank',
            swishlastmodified   =&gt; 'Last Modified Date',
            swishdocpath        =&gt; 'Document Path',
            swishdocsize        =&gt; 'Document Size',
        },

    };</pre>
<p>The above configuration defines metanames to use on the form.
Searches can be limited to these metanames.</p>
<p>"display_props" tells the script to display the property "swishlastmodified" (the last modified
date of the file), the document size, and path with the search results.</p>
<p>The parameter "name_labels" is a hash (reference)
that is used to give friendly names to the metanames.</p>
<p>Here's another example.  Say you want to search either (or both) the Apache 1.3 documentation and the
Apache 2.0 documentation indexed seperately.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    return {
       title       =&gt; 'Search the Apache Documentation',
       date_ranges =&gt; 0,
       swish_index =&gt; [ qw/ index.apache index.apache2 / ],
       select_indexes  =&gt; {
            method  =&gt; 'checkbox_group',
            labels  =&gt; [ '1.3.23 docs', '2.0 docs' ],  # Must match up one-to-one to swish_index
            description =&gt; 'Select: ',
        },

    };</pre>
<p>Now you can select either or both sets of documentation while searching.</p>
<p>All the possible settings are included in the default configuration located near the top of the <i>swish.cgi</i>
script.  Open the <i>swish.cgi</i> script with an editor to look at the various settings.  Contact the Swish-e Discussion list
for help in configuring the script.</p>

<h1><a name="debugging"></a>DEBUGGING</h1>

<p>Most problems with using this script have been a result of improper configuration.  Please
get the script working with default settings before adjusting the configuration settings.</p>
<p>The key to debugging CGI scripts is to run them from the command line, not with a browser.</p>
<p>First, make sure the program compiles correctly:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    $ perl -c swish.cgi
    swish.cgi syntax OK</pre>
<p>Next, simply try running the program:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    $ ./swish.cgi | head
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
           &lt;title&gt;
              Search our site
           &lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;</pre>
<p>Under Windows you will need to run the script as:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">   C:\wwwroot\swishtest&gt; perl swish.cgi</pre>
<p>Now, you know that the program compiles and will run from the command line.
Next, try accessing the script from a web browser.</p>
<p>If you see the contents of the CGI script instead of its output then
your web server is not configured to run the script.  With Apache look
at settings like ScriptAlias, SetHandler, and Options.</p>
<p>If an error is reported (such as Internal Server Error or Forbidden)
you need to locate your web server's error_log file and carefully read
what the problem is.  Contact your web administrator for help locating
the web server's error log.</p>
<p>If you don't have access to the web server's error_log file, you can
modify the script to report errors to the browser screen.  Open the
script and search for "CGI::Carp".  (Author's suggestion is to debug
from the command line -- adding the browser and web server into the
equation only complicates debugging.)</p>
<p>The script does offer some basic debugging options that allow
debugging from the command line.  The debugging options are enabled by
setting an environment variable "SWISH_DEBUG".  How that is set
depends on your operating system and the shell you are using.  These
examples are using the "bash" shell syntax.</p>
<p>Note: You can also use the "debug_options" configuration setting, but
the recommended method is to set the environment variable.</p>
<p>You can list the available debugging options like this:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    $ SWISH_DEBUG=help ./swish.cgi &gt;outfile
    Unknown debug option 'help'.  Must be one of:
           basic: Basic debugging
         command: Show command used to run swish
         headers: Show headers returned from swish
          output: Show output from swish
         summary: Show summary of results
            dump: Show all data available to templates</pre>
<p>Debugging options may be combined:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    $ SWISH_DEBUG=command,headers,summary ./swish.cgi &gt;outfile</pre>
<p>You will be asked for an input query and the max number of results to return.  You can use the defaults
in most cases.  It's a good idea to redirect output to a file.  Any error messages are sent to stderr, so
those will still be displayed (unless you redirect stderr, too).</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ SWISH_DEBUG=basic ./swish.cgi &gt;outfile
    Debug level set to: 1
    Enter a query [all]:
    Using 'not asdfghjklzxcv' to match all records
    Enter max results to display [1]:

<p>The above indicates two problems.  First problem is that the Date::Calc module is not installed.
The Date::Calc module is needed to use the date limiting feature of the script.</p>
<p>The second problem is a bit more serious.  It's saying that the script can't find the
swish-e binary file. In this example it's specified as being in the current directory.
Either correct the path to the swish-e binary, or make a local copy or symlink to the
swish-e binary.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ cat .swishcgi.conf
        return {

           date_ranges =&gt; 0,
        };</pre>
<p>Now, let's try again:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ SWISH_DEBUG=basic ./swish.cgi &gt;outfile
    Debug level set to: 1

    ---------- Read config parameters from '.swishcgi.conf' ------

              'title' =&gt; 'Search the Apache Documentation'
            };
    -------------------------
    Enter a query [all]:
    Using 'not asdfghjklzxcv' to match all records
    Enter max results to display [1]:

<p>This means that the swish.cgi script could not locate a required module.  To correct this
locate where the SWISH::Template module is installed and add a "use lib" line to
your configuration file (or to the swish.cgi script):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ cat .swishcgi.conf
    use lib '/home/bill/local/lib/perl';

    return {
       title       =&gt; 'Search the Apache Documentation',
       date_ranges =&gt; 0,

    -------------------------
    Enter a query [all]:
    Using 'not asdfghjklzxcv' to match all records
    Enter max results to display [1]:
    Found 1 results</pre>
<p>That is much better!</p>
<p>The "use lib" statement tells Perl where to look for modules by adding the path supplied
to an array called @INC.</p>
<p>Note that most modules are in the SWISH namespace.  For example, the default output
module is called SWISH::TemplateDefault.  When Perl is looking for that module it is looking for
the file <i>SWISH/TemplateDefault.pm</i>.  If the "use lib" statement is set as:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use lib '/home/bill/local/lib/perl';</pre>
<p>then Perl will look (among other places) for the file</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    /home/bill/local/lib/perl/SWISH/TemplateDefault.pm</pre>
<p>when attempting to load the SWISH::TemplateDefault module.  Relative paths may also be used.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use lib 'modules';</pre>
<p>will cause Perl to look for the file:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ./modules/SWISH/TemplateDefault.pm</pre>
<p>relative to where the swish.cgi script is running.  (This is not true when running under mod_perl).</p>
<p>Here's another common problem.  Everything checks out, but when you run the script you see
the message:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    Swish returned unknown output</pre>
<p>Ok, let's find out what output it is returning:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest$ SWISH_DEBUG=headers,output ./swish.cgi &gt;outfile

<h1><a name="frequently_asked_questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>Here's some common questions and answers.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="how_do_i_change_the_way_the_output_looks_"></a>How do I change the way the output looks?</h2>

<p>The script uses a module to generate output.  By default it uses the
SWISH::TemplateDefault.pm module. The module used is selected in the
swish.cgi configuration file.  Modules are located in the
example/modules/SWISH directory in the distribution, but are installed in
the $prefix/lib/swish-e/perl/SWISH/ directory.</p>
<p>To make simple changes you can edit the installed SWISH::TemplatDefault
module directly, otherwise make a copy of the module and modify its package
name.  For example, change directories to the location of the installed
module and copy the module to a new name:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    $ cp TemplateDefault.pm MyTemplateDefault.pm</pre>
<p>Then at the top of the module adjust the "package" line to:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    package SWISH::MyTemplateDefault;</pre>
<p>To use this modules you need to adjust the configuration settings (either at
the top of <i>swish.cgi</i> or in a configuration file:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">        template =&gt; {
            package     =&gt; 'SWISH::MyTemplateDefault',
        },</pre>
<p>The module does not need to be in the SWISH namespace, and can be stored in
any location as long as the module can be found via the @INC array (i.e.
modify the "use lib" statement in swish.cgi if needed).</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="how_do_i_use_a_templating_system_with_swish_cgi_"></a>How do I use a templating system with swish.cgi?</h2>

<p>In addition to the TemplateDefault.pm module, the swish-e distribution includes two other Perl modules for
generating output using the templating systems HTML::Template and Template-Toolkit.</p>
<p>Templating systems use template files to generate the HTML, and make maintaining the look of a large (or small) site
much easier. HTML::Template and Template-Toolkit are separate packages and can be downloaded from the CPAN.
See <a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a>.</p>
<p>Two basic templates are provided as examples for generating output using these templating systems.
The example templates are located in the <i>example</i> directory.
The module <i>SWISH::TemplateHTMLTemplate</i> uses the file <i>swish.tmpl</i> to generate its output, while the
module <i>SWISH::TemplateToolkit</i> uses the <i>swish.tt</i> file.
(Note: swish.tt was renamed from search.tt Jun 03, 2004.)</p>
<p>To use either of these modules you will need to adjust the "template" configuration setting.  Examples for
both templating systems are provided in the configuration settings near the top of the <i>swish.cgi</i> program.</p>
<p>Use of these modules is an advanced usage of <i>swish.cgi</i> and are provided as examples only.</p>
<p>All of the output generation modules are passed a hash with the results from the search, plus other data use to create the
output page.  You can see this hash by using the debugging option "dump" or by using the included SWISH::TemplateDumper
module:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest &gt;cat .swishcgi.conf
        return {
           title       =&gt; 'Search the Apache Documentation',
           template =&gt; {
                package     =&gt; 'SWISH::TemplateDumper',
            },
        };</pre>
<p>And run a query.  For example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    http://localhost/swishtest/swish.cgi?query=install</pre>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="why_are_there_three_different_highlighting_modules_"></a>Why are there three different highlighting modules?</h2>

<p>Three are three highlighting modules included with the swish-e distribution.
Each is a trade-off of speed vs. accuracy:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    SWISH::DefaultHighlight - reasonably fast, but does not highlight phrases
    SWISH::PhraseHighlight  - reasonably slow, but is reasonably accurate
    SWISH::SimpleHighlight  - fast, some phrases, but least accurate</pre>
<p>Eh, the default is actually "PhraseHighlight".  Oh well.</p>
<p>All of the highlighting modules slow down the script.  Optimizations to these modules are welcome!</p>

<h2><a name="my_isp_doesn_t_provide_access_to_the_web_server_logs"></a>My ISP doesn't provide access to the web server logs</h2>

<p>There are a number of options.  One way it to use the CGI::Carp module.  Search in the
swish.cgi script for:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use Carp;
    # Or use this instead -- PLEASE see perldoc CGI::Carp for details
    # use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser warningsToBrowser);</pre>
<p>And change it to look like:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    #use Carp;
    # Or use this instead -- PLEASE see perldoc CGI::Carp for details
    use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser warningsToBrowser);</pre>
<p>This should be only for debugging purposes, as if used in production you may end up sending
quite ugly and confusing messages to your browsers.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h2><a name="why_does_the_output_show_null_"></a>Why does the output show (NULL)?</h2>

<p>Swish-e displays (NULL) when attempting to display a property that does not exist in the index.</p>
<p>The most common reason for this message is that you did not use StoreDescription in your config file while indexing.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    StoreDescription HTML* &lt;body&gt; 200000</pre>
<p>That tells swish to store the first 200,000 characters of text extracted from the body of each document parsed
by the HTML parser.  The text is stored as property "swishdescription".</p>
<p>The index must be recreated after changing the swish-e configuration.</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest &gt; ./swish-e -T index_metanames</pre>
<p>will display the properties defined in your index file.</p>
<p>This can happen with other properties, too.
For example, this will happen when you are asking for a property to display that is not defined in swish.</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest &gt; ./swish-e -w install -m 1 -p foo
    # SWISH format: 2.1-dev-25
    # Search words: install
    err: Unknown Display property name "foo"
    .

    ~/swishtest &gt; ./swish-e -w install -m 1 -x 'Property foo=&lt;foo&gt;\n'
    # SWISH format: 2.1-dev-25
    # Search words: install
    # Number of hits: 14
    # Search time: 0.000 seconds
    # Run time: 0.038 seconds
    Property foo=(NULL)
    .</pre>
<p>To check that a property exists in your index you can run:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest &gt; ./swish-e -w not dkdk -T index_metanames | grep foo
            foo : id=10 type=70  META_PROP:STRING(case:ignore) *presorted*</pre>
<p>Ok, in this case we see that "foo" is really defined as a property.  Now let's make sure <i>swish.cgi</i>
is asking for "foo" (sorry for the long lines):</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    ~/swishtest &gt; SWISH_DEBUG=command ./swish.cgi &gt; /dev/null
    Debug level set to: 3
    Enter a query [all]:
    Using 'not asdfghjklzxcv' to match all records
    Enter max results to display [1]:
    ---- Running swish with the following command and parameters ----
    ./swish-e  \
    -w  \
    'swishdefault=(not asdfghjklzxcv)'  \
    -b  \
    1  \
    -m  \
    1  \
    -f  \
    index.swish-e  \
    -s  \
    swishrank  \
    desc  \
    swishlastmodified  \
    desc  \
    -x  \
    '&lt;swishreccount&gt;\t&lt;swishtitle&gt;\t&lt;swishdescription&gt;\t&lt;swishlastmodified&gt;\t&lt;swishdocsize&gt;\t&lt;swishdocpath&gt;\t&lt;fos&gt;\t&lt;swishrank&gt;\t&lt;swishdocpath&gt;\n'  \
    -H  \
    9</pre>
<p>If you look carefully you will see that the -x parameter has "fos" instead of "foo", so there's our problem.</p>

<h2><a name="how_do_i_use_the_swish_api_perl_module_with_swish_cgi_"></a>How do I use the SWISH::API perl module with swish.cgi?</h2>

<p>Use the <code>use_library</code> configuration directive:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use_library =&gt; 1,</pre>
<p>This will only provide improved performance when running under mod_perl or other persistent
environments.</p>

    </div>

<h2><a name="why_does_the_run_time_differ_when_using_the_swish_api_module"></a>Why does the &quot;Run time&quot; differ when using the SWISH::API module</h2>

<p>When using the SWISH::API module the run (and search) times are calculated
within the script.  When using the swish-e binary the swish-e program reports the
times.  The "Run time" may include the time required to load and compile the SWISH::API
module.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
        
<h1><a name="mod_perl"></a>MOD_PERL</h1>

<p>This script can be run under mod_perl (see <a href="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</a>).
This will improve the response time of the script compared to running under CGI by loading the
swish.cgi script into the Apache web server.</p>
<p>You must have a mod_perl enabled Apache server to run this script under mod_perl.</p>
<p>Configuration is simple.  In your httpd.conf or your startup.pl file you need to
load the script.  For example, in httpd.conf you can use a perl section:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    &lt;perl&gt;
        use lib '/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin';  # location of the swish.cgi file
        use lib '/home/yourname/swish-e/example/modules';  # modules required by swish.cgi
        require "swish.cgi";
    &lt;/perl&gt;</pre>
<p>Again, note that the paths used will depend on where you installed the script and the modules.
When running under mod_perl the swish.cgi script becomes a perl module, and therefore the script
does not need to be installed in the cgi-bin directory.  (But, you can actually use the same script as
both a CGI script and a mod_perl module at the same time, read from the same location.)</p>
<p>The above loads the script into mod_perl.  Then to configure the script to run add this to your httpd.conf
configuration file:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    &lt;location /search&gt;
        PerlSetVar Swish_Conf_File /home/yourname/swish-e/myconfig.pl
        allow from all
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler SwishSearch
    &lt;/location&gt;</pre>
<p>Note that you use the "Swish_Conf_File" setting in httpd.conf to tell the script
which config file to use.  This means you can use the same script (and loaded modules)
for different search sites (running on the same Apache server).  You can just specify
differnt config files for each Location and they can search different indexes and
have a completely different look for each site, but all share the same code.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> that the config files are cached in the swish.cgi script.  Changes to the config file
will require restarting the Apache server before they will be reloaded into the swish.cgi
script.  This avoids calling stat() for every request.</p>
<p>Unlike CGI, mod_perl does not change the current directory to the location of the script, so
your settings for the swish binary and the path to your index files must be absolute
paths (or relative to the server root).</p>
<p>Using the SWISH::API module with mod_perl will provide the most performance improvements.
Use of the SWISH::API module can be enabled by the configuration setting <code>use_library</code>:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use_library     =&gt; 1,</pre>
<p>Without highlighting code enabled, using the SWISH::API module resulted in about 20 requests
per second, where running the swish-e binary slowed the script down to about 8 requests per second.</p>
<p>Note that the highlighting code is slow.  For the best search performance turn off highlighting.
In your config file you can add:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    highlighting    =&gt; 0,  # disable highlighting</pre>
<p>and the script will show the first 500 chars of the description (or whatever you set for "max_chars").
Without highlight one test was processing about 20 request per second.
With The "PhraseHighlight" module that dropped to a little better than two requests per second,
"DefaultHighlight" was about 2.3 request per second, and "SimpleHighlight" was about 6 request per second.</p>
<p>Experiement with different highlighting options when testing performance.</p>
<p>Please post to the swish-e discussion list if you have any questions about running this
script under mod_perl.</p>
<p>Here's some general request/second on an Athlon XP 1800+ with 1/2GB RAM, Linux 2.4.20.</p>

<h1><a name="speedycgi"></a>SpeedyCGI</h1>

<p>SpeedyCGI (also called PersistentPerl) is another way to run Perl scripts persistently.
SpeedyCGI is good if you do not have mod_perl available or do not have root access.
SpeedyCGI works on Unix systems by loading the script into a "back end" process and keeping
it in memory between requests.  New requests are passed to the back end processes which avoids
the startup time required by a Perl CGI script.</p>
<p>Install SpeedyCGI from <a href="http://daemoninc.com/">http://daemoninc.com/</a> (your OS may provide a packaged version of
SpeedyCGI) and then change the first line of swish.cgi.  For example, if the speedy binary is
installed in /usr/bin/speedy, use the line:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    #! /usr/bin/speedy -w -- -t60</pre>
<p>The -w option is passed to Perl, and all options following the double-dash are SpeedyCGI options.</p>
<p>Note that when using SpeedyCGI configuration data is cached in memory.  If you change the swish.cgi
configuration file (.swishcgi.conf) then touch the main swish.cgi script to force reloading of
configuration data.</p>

<h1><a name="spidering"></a>Spidering</h1>

<p>There are two ways to spider with swish-e.  One uses the "http" input method that uses code that's
part of swish.  The other way is to use the new "prog" method along with a perl helper program called
<code>spider.pl</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a configuration file for spidering with the "http" input method.
You can see that the configuration is not much different than the file system input method.
(But, don't use the http input method -- use the -S prog method shown below.)</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    # Define what to index
    IndexDir http://www.myserver.name/index.html
    IndexOnly .html .htm

    IndexContents HTML* .html .htm
    DefaultContents HTML*
    StoreDescription HTML* &lt;body&gt; 200000
    MetaNames swishdocpath swishtitle

    # Define http method specific settings -- see swish-e documentation
    SpiderDirectory ../swish-e/src/
    Delay 0</pre>
<p>You index with the command:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -S http -c spider.conf</pre>
<p>Note that this does take longer.  For example, spidering the Apache documentation on
a local web server with this method took over a minute, where indexing with the
file system took less than two seconds.  Using the "prog" method can speed this up.</p>
<p>Here's an example configuration file for using the "prog" input method:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    # Define the location of the spider helper program
    IndexDir ../swish-e/prog-bin/spider.pl

    # Tell the spider what to index.
    SwishProgParameters default http://www.myserver.name/index.html

    IndexContents HTML* .html .htm
    DefaultContents HTML*
    StoreDescription HTML* &lt;body&gt; 200000
    MetaNames swishdocpath swishtitle</pre>
<p>Then to index you use the command:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    swish-e -c prog.conf -S prog -v 0</pre>
<p>Spidering with this method took nine seconds.</p>

<h1><a name="stemmed_indexes"></a>Stemmed Indexes</h1>

<p>Many people enable a feature of swish called word stemming to provide
"fuzzy" search options to their users.  The stemming code does not
actually find the "stem" of word, rather removes and/or replaces
common endings on words.  Stemming is far from perfect, and many words
do not stem as you might expect.  Plus, currently only English is
supported.  But, it can be a helpful tool for searching your site.
You may wish to create both a stemmed and non-stemmed index, and
provide a checkbox for selecting the index file.</p>
<p>To enable a stemmed index you simply add to your configuration file:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    UseStemming yes</pre>
<p>If you want to use a stemmed index with this program and continue to highlight search terms you will need
to install a perl module that will stem words.  This section explains how to do this.</p>
<p>The perl module is included with the swish-e distribution.  It can be found in the examples directory (where
you found this file) and called something like:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    SWISH-Stemmer-0.05.tar.gz</pre>
<p>The module should also be available on CPAN (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>).</p>
<p>Here's an example session for installing the module.  (There will be quite a bit of output
when running make.)</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    % gzip -dc SWISH-Stemmer-0.05.tar.gz |tar xof -
    % cd SWISH-Stemmer-0.05
    % perl Makefile.PL
    or
    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/perl_lib
    % make
    % make test

    (perhaps su root at this point if you did not use a PREFIX)
    % make install
    % cd ..</pre>
<p>Use the <b>PREFIX</b> if you do not have root access or you want to install the modules
in a local library.  If you do use a PREFIX setting, add a <code>use lib</code> statement to the top of this
swish.cgi program.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="pre-section">    use lib qw(
        /home/bmoseley/perl_lib/lib/site_perl/5.6.0
        /home/bmoseley/perl_lib/lib/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/
    );</pre>
<p>Once the stemmer module is installed, and you are using a stemmed index, the <code>swish.cgi</code> script will automatically
detect this and use the stemmer module.</p>
